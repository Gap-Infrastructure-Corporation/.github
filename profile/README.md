### WHO WE ARE
From ambitious beginnings in 2009 to a powerhouse of industry, the Gap Infrastructure Corporation’s history is a story of hard work, dedication, solid relationships, and optimism overcoming obstacles.

What began as a start-up named Barzani Group in the construction space has now diversified into a leading infrastructure developer committed to closing the gap between the existing infrastructure and the infrastructure that is needed. With a committed book of billions of Rands – and counting: we are set to continue growing both organically and acquisitively.

### OUR FUTURE, AN EXISTING WORK IN PROGRESS
The Gap Infrastructure Corporation is intent on leaving a bequest that’s much more precious: empowering people with jobs, skills, homes and the wherewithal to live a life of dignity and optimism.
